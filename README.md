# HTML Practice Project

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹  
This is a simple project I built using **only HTML** to refresh and test my core web development skills. No CSS, no JavaScriptâ€”just clean, structured HTML.

## ðŸ“Œ Why I Made This
Sometimes it's good to go back to the basics. I wanted to:
- Revisit HTML elements and tags
- Check if I still remember semantic structure
- Practice building a basic layout from scratch

## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Inside
- A homepage with simple structure
- Use of headings, paragraphs, lists, images, links, and forms
- Clean and readable HTML code

## ðŸŒ± What I Learned (or Re-learned!)
- Proper use of semantic tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, etc.)
- Importance of clean indentation and structure
- How to build a static webpage from the ground up

## ðŸ“‚ How to Use
Just open the `index.html` file in your browser and explore!

## âœ¨ Final Thoughts
This was a fun little exercise and a great reminder that even with just HTML, you can lay the foundation for any website. Feel free to check it out and maybe even fork it for your own practice!
